**PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-Job-Simulation**

The virtual PowerBI Case experience is an excellant starting point for a Data Analyst looking to build a career with Power BI. This experince consists of three case studies on three different datasets. The real world datasets help you understand the business scenarios and steps to solve the business problems.

**1. Call Centre Trends**
This case study deals with the Call Centre Trends. Here, we analyze the number of incoming calls, call agent's performance, speed of answer, call duration, trends on daily and hourly basis and customer satisfaction ratings. The dashboard defines key KPIs that impact the customer satisfaction as well as performance of the call agents. The goal is to identify opprtunities where the performance can be monitored and enhanced.

**Task**
It’s omnipresent: telecom marketing. Better price here. Better service there. Best for small businesses here. Best for young urbanites there. But what do customers really want? Our client, a big telecom company needs to know. Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Overall customer satisfaction Overall calls answered/abandoned Calls by time Average speed of answer Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

**2. Customer Retention Dashboard**
The organisation is keen to know the possible customers who are likely to churn. In this Dashboard, we create KPIs around demographics, company service and customer profiling to know which of them have the highest chance of getting churned. The analysis depicts some key insights that will help the board member take steps in future to reduce the churning rate and increase customer loyalty.

**Task**
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

**3. HR Analytics - Diversity and Inclusivity**

**Task**
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Why is this so?

Think about the importance of strategy, awareness and education, analytics and inspiration.

Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

No. of men No. of women No. of leavers % employees promoted (FY21) % of women promoted % of hires men % of hires women % turnover Average performance rating: men Average Performance rating: women
